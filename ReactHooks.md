# React Hooks

# What is Hooks?
- Hooks are special functions, that allow us to use state and other React features in function components.
- Earlier, When we used to create react app using Function component, then we didn't hahve access to the state management and lifecycle methods.

- To access these features we had to add class components, so this was the problem with functional component.

-  But aftet introducing React Hooks from version 16.8, we can now use state management and other react features without class components.

- In other words, Hooks are the functions that make function compoenents work like class components.

- Hooks made react functional compoenents so easy to use.

- Developers prefer function components over class componenets.

# Benefits of React Hooks?
- React hooks simplify the code, improves the readability resusability and overall performance of the application.

- Most commonly used hooks are:
    - useState
    - useEffect
    - useRef
    - useMemo
    - useCallback
    - useContext
    - useReducer
    - useLayoutEffect
    - custom hook

1. useState Hook in React
- useState is a react hooks, which creates an "state varivale".
- which helps us to track state in components & updates the user interface when state chnages.

# Explanation of `useState` in React

The `useState` hook in React is used to manage state in functional components. It allows you to create state variables and functions to update them. Here’s an explanation of your code:

## Code Breakdown

```javascript
const counter = useState(0);
const setcounter = useState(0)[1];

console.log(counter); // here we get the [0, function]
console.log(setcounter);
```

### 1. **`useState(0)`**
- `useState` is a React hook that initializes a state variable. It takes an initial value as its argument (in this case, `0`).
- It returns an array with two elements:
  1. The **current state value** (initially `0`).
  2. A **function to update the state value**.

### 2. **`const counter = useState(0);`**
- This creates a variable `counter` that stores the array returned by `useState`.
- In this case, `counter` will be:
  ```javascript
  [0, function]
  ```
  - `0`: The current state value (initial value provided to `useState`).
  - `function`: A function to update the state value.

### 3. **`const setcounter = useState(0)[1];`**
- This directly extracts the second element of the array returned by `useState(0)`.
- `setcounter` is the function that can be used to update the state value.

### 4. **`console.log(counter)`**
- This logs the array returned by `useState`:
  ```javascript
  [0, function]
  ```

### 5. **`console.log(setcounter)`**
- This logs the state updater function. You would see something like:
  ```javascript
  function setState() { [native code] }
  ```

## Example of Usage
To use `counter` and `setcounter` effectively:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function CounterComponent() {
    const counter = useState(0); // Full array
    const setcounter = useState(0)[1]; // Only state updater

    // Or more commonly:
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Destructuring for readability

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default CounterComponent;
```

### Explanation of Example
- **`count`**: Holds the current state value.
- **`setCount`**: Updates the state value. When called, it triggers a re-render of the component with the updated state.

Using array destructuring (`[count, setCount]`) is the standard practice because it improves code readability and avoids confusion when working with state variables.

# Explanation of the Spread Operator (`...`) in JavaScript

In JavaScript, the syntax `...car` is called the **spread operator**. It is used to copy the properties of an object (or elements of an array) into a new object (or array). Here’s a detailed explanation of how it works in your code:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax

## Code Breakdown

```javascript
setCount((car) => {
     return { ...car, color: "blue" }
})
```

### 1. **`setCount`**
This seems to be a function, likely from a React state update (e.g., `useState`).

### 2. **`(car) => {}`**
This is an arrow function. It takes the current state object (`car`) as its parameter.

### 3. **`return { ...car, color: "blue" }`**
- **`...car`**: This copies all the key-value pairs from the `car` object into a new object.
- **`color: "blue"`**: This adds or updates the `color` property in the new object. If `color` already exists in `car`, its value will be overwritten with `"blue"`. If it doesn’t exist, it will be added.

## Example

Let’s say the current `car` object looks like this:

```javascript
const car = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  color: "red",
};
```

When the function runs, `...car` will copy all the properties (`make`, `model`, and `color`) into a new object. Then, the `color` property will be updated to `"blue"`. The result is:

```javascript
{
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  color: "blue",
}
```

## Why Use `...car`?

The spread operator ensures that the original `car` object is not mutated. Instead, a new object is created with the updated properties. This is important in React (and functional programming in general) to maintain immutability, which helps ensure predictable state updates and avoids side effects.

# Explanation of `useState` with Functional Updates in React

The `useState` hook in React provides a way to manage state, and it allows both direct updates and functional updates. The code below demonstrates the difference and how functional updates work.

## Code Breakdown

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const increaseCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Direct update
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1); // Functional update #1
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1); // Functional update #2
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1); // Functional update #3
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1); // Functional update #4
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1); // Functional update #5
};
```

### 1. **`const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`**
- `count`: Holds the current state value, initialized to `0`.
- `setCount`: A function to update the `count` state.

### 2. **`setCount(count + 1);` (Direct Update)**
- This updates the state using the **current value of `count`**.
- However, React batches state updates for performance reasons. If multiple calls to `setCount` are made, they may overwrite each other because they rely on the same `count` value at the time of the update.

### 3. **`setCount((prev) => prev + 1);` (Functional Update)**
- Here, a **functional update** is used.
- The `prev` argument represents the most recent state value.
- Functional updates ensure that each update works on the latest state, avoiding issues caused by batched updates.

### Behavior

When `increaseCount` is called:
1. **`setCount(count + 1);`**: Updates the state to `count + 1` (based on the current `count` value). Due to batching, this might not behave as expected when followed by other updates.
2. Each **`setCount((prev) => prev + 1);`** increments the state by `1` sequentially using the latest state value (`prev`).

### Final State

- **Direct Update**:
  - If `count` is `0` at the time `setCount(count + 1)` is executed, it will update `count` to `1`. However, subsequent functional updates do not depend on this directly updated value.
- **Functional Updates**:
  - Each `setCount((prev) => prev + 1)` adds `1` to the current state (`prev`).
  - Since there are 5 functional updates, the state will increment by `5`.

The final state of `count` will be:
```javascript
0 + 1 (direct update) + 5 (functional updates) = 6
```

## Why Use Functional Updates?
Functional updates are recommended when the new state depends on the previous state. They ensure correctness in asynchronous or batched scenarios, which are common in React.

## Example of Usage
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increaseCount = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);
        setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
        setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
        setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
        setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
        setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={increaseCount}>Increase Count</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Key Takeaway
Use functional updates when the new state depends on the previous state to avoid issues caused by React's batching mechanism. This ensures predictable and consistent state updates.

# UseEffect Hook
## The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.

## Some examples of side effects are:
- Fetching data from API
- Directly updating the DOM
- Timer like SetTimeOut and SetInterval
# Complete Explanation of `useEffect` in React

The `useEffect` hook in React is a powerful tool for managing side effects in functional components. It allows you to perform actions such as fetching data, updating the DOM, or subscribing to events in response to changes in state or props.

## Syntax
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    // Side effect logic here
    return () => {
        // Cleanup logic here (optional)
    };
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Parameters:
1. **Callback Function**:
   - This is the main function where the side effect logic is implemented.
   - Optionally returns a cleanup function.

2. **Dependency Array**:
   - A list of dependencies that the effect depends on.
   - Controls when the effect is executed.

## Behavior of `useEffect`
### 1. **Without a Dependency Array**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Effect ran");
});
```
- The effect runs **after every render** (initial render and subsequent updates).
- This can lead to performance issues if not used carefully.

### 2. **With an Empty Dependency Array**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Effect ran");
}, []);
```
- The effect runs **only once**, after the initial render.
- Commonly used for actions like fetching data when the component mounts.

### 3. **With Specific Dependencies**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Effect ran due to change in 'count'");
}, [count]);
```
- The effect runs **only when `count` changes**.
- React compares the current and previous values of `count` to decide whether to re-run the effect.

### 4. **With a Cleanup Function**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
        console.log("Timer running");
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
        clearInterval(timer);
        console.log("Cleanup");
    };
}, []);
```
- The cleanup function runs **before the effect re-runs** or **when the component unmounts**.
- Useful for cleaning up subscriptions, timers, or event listeners.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. **Fetching Data**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    };
    fetchData();
}, []);
```
- Runs once when the component mounts to fetch data.

### 2. **Event Listeners**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
        console.log(window.innerWidth);
    };

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);

    return () => {
        window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    };
}, []);
```
- Adds an event listener when the component mounts and removes it when unmounting.

### 3. **Subscribing to External Services**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = someService.subscribe(() => {
        console.log("Service updated");
    });

    return () => {
        subscription.unsubscribe();
    };
}, []);
```
- Ensures proper cleanup when the component unmounts.

### 4. **Syncing with State Changes**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);
```
- Updates the document title whenever `count` changes.

### 5. **Using `setTimeout` Inside `useEffect`**:
```javascript
const [count, setcount] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
    console.log("above settimeout");

    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("inside settimeout");
        setcount(count => count + 1);
    }, 2000);
}, []);
```
#### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `count` is initialized to `0` using `useState`.

2. **Effect Logic**:
   - The `useEffect` hook runs after the initial render because the dependency array is empty (`[]`).
   - Inside the effect, a `setTimeout` is started to delay execution of its callback function by 2 seconds.

3. **`setTimeout` Callback**:
   - After 2 seconds, the callback is executed, logging "inside settimeout" to the console.
   - The `setcount` function is called with an updater function, which increments the current value of `count` by `1`.

4. **Why Use an Updater Function?**:
   - The updater function (`count => count + 1`) ensures the correct value of `count` is used, even if multiple state updates occur asynchronously.

5. **Result**:
   - After 2 seconds, `count` is updated from `0` to `1`, triggering a re-render of the component.

#### Key Points:
- The empty dependency array ensures the effect runs only once after the initial render.
- Using `setTimeout` inside `useEffect` is common for delaying actions.
- The updater function in `setcount` ensures state updates are reliable.

## Key Points to Remember
1. **Runs After Render**:
   - Effects always run after the component has rendered and updated the DOM.

2. **Dependencies are Crucial**:
   - Specify all variables used in the effect in the dependency array to avoid bugs.

3. **Avoid Infinite Loops**:
   - Not providing a dependency array or having incorrect dependencies can lead to infinite re-renders.

4. **Multiple Effects**:
   - You can use multiple `useEffect` calls in the same component to separate concerns.

5. **Debugging Dependencies**:
   - React's strict mode or ESLint will often warn you about missing dependencies in `useEffect`.

## Example Component
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log(`Count updated to: ${count}`);
    }, [count]);

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("Component mounted");
        return () => {
            console.log("Component unmounted");
        };
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

## Conclusion
The `useEffect` hook is versatile and essential for managing side effects in functional components. By understanding its behavior and best practices, you can ensure your React applications are efficient, predictable, and bug-free.

# UseEffect Hook

## useRef is a react Hook that allow us to create mutable varibales,which will not re-render the component when its change.

# Complete Explanation of `useRef` in React

The `useRef` hook in React is a powerful tool for accessing and manipulating DOM elements, as well as maintaining mutable values that do not trigger re-renders. It provides a way to store a reference to a value or DOM node that persists across renders.

## Syntax
```javascript
const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);
```

### Parameters:
- **initialValue**: The initial value for the `current` property of the ref object.

### Returns:
- A mutable object with a single property, `current`, initialized to the `initialValue`.

## Common Use Cases for `useRef`

### 1. **Accessing DOM Elements**
`useRef` is often used to directly access and manipulate a DOM element without re-rendering the component.

#### Example:
```javascript
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function InputFocus() {
    const inputRef = useRef(null);

    const focusInput = () => {
        inputRef.current.focus(); // Accesses the DOM node directly
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <input ref={inputRef} type="text" placeholder="Click the button to focus" />
            <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default InputFocus;
```
#### Explanation:
- `useRef` creates a reference to the input element.
- The `focusInput` function accesses the DOM node via `inputRef.current` and calls its `focus()` method.

### 2. **Storing Mutable Values**
`useRef` can hold mutable values that persist across renders without causing re-renders.

#### Example:
```javascript
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const countRef = useRef(0);
    const [renderCount, setRenderCount] = useState(0);

    const incrementCount = () => {
        countRef.current += 1; // Updates the value
        console.log(`Count (ref): ${countRef.current}`);
    };

    const reRender = () => {
        setRenderCount(renderCount + 1); // Triggers a re-render
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Render Count: {renderCount}</p>
            <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment Count (Ref)</button>
            <button onClick={reRender}>Re-Render</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```
#### Explanation:
- `countRef` holds a value (`0`) that persists across renders but does not cause the component to re-render when updated.
- This is useful for scenarios where you need to maintain a value but avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 3. **Tracking Previous State or Props**
`useRef` can store the previous value of a state or prop to compare with the current value.

#### Example:
```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function PreviousStateTracker() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    const prevCountRef = useRef();

    useEffect(() => {
        prevCountRef.current = count; // Update the ref with the current count after render
    });

    const prevCount = prevCountRef.current;

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Current Count: {count}</p>
            <p>Previous Count: {prevCount}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default PreviousStateTracker;
```
#### Explanation:
- `prevCountRef` stores the previous value of `count`.
- `useEffect` updates the ref after every render.
- This allows you to compare the current and previous values without triggering a re-render.

### 4. **Avoiding Re-Creation of Expensive Objects**
`useRef` can store a value that doesn’t need to be re-created on every render.

#### Example:
```javascript
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function ExpensiveObject() {
    const expensiveObjectRef = useRef({ key: "value" });

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Expensive Object: {JSON.stringify(expensiveObjectRef.current)}</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default ExpensiveObject;
```
#### Explanation:
- The object stored in `expensiveObjectRef` remains the same across renders, saving computational resources.

### 5. **Integrating with Third-Party Libraries**
When using third-party libraries that require direct access to DOM nodes, `useRef` can provide a reference to the required DOM element.

## Key Points to Remember
1. **Does Not Trigger Re-Renders**:
   - Updating the `current` property of a `useRef` object does not cause a re-render.

2. **Persists Across Renders**:
   - The value of `current` is maintained across renders, making it ideal for storing mutable values.

3. **Avoid Overuse**:
   - Avoid using `useRef` for managing state. Use `useState` or `useReducer` for state management instead.

4. **Accessing DOM Elements**:
   - `useRef` is the recommended way to interact with DOM elements in functional components.

5. **Alternative to Instance Variables**:
   - `useRef` can replace instance variables in class components.

## Comparison with Other Hooks
| Feature              | `useRef`                          | `useState`                     | `useEffect`               |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Triggers Re-Renders  | No                                | Yes                             | Not Applicable           |
| Mutable Values       | Yes                               | No                              | No                        |
| DOM Manipulation     | Yes                               | No                              | No                        |
| Dependency Tracking  | No                                | No                              | Yes                       |

## Conclusion
The `useRef` hook is an essential tool in React for handling scenarios where you need persistent, mutable values or direct access to DOM elements. By understanding its strengths and limitations, you can use it effectively to build performant and maintainable applications.

# UseEffect Hook

## The React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value. ( it's like caching a value so that it doesn't need to be recalculated. ) the useMemo Hooks only runs when one of the its dependencies gets updated.

## This can improve the performance of the application. there is one more hook in react to improve performance, that is useCallback hook.

## The useMemo and useCallback Hooks are similar. The main difference is:
- useMemo returns a memoized value.
- useCallback returns a memoied function.

# Understanding `useMemo` in React

## What is `useMemo`?

`useMemo` is a React Hook that optimizes performance by memoizing the result of a computation. It ensures that a function is only re-evaluated when its dependencies change, avoiding unnecessary recalculations on every render.

`useMemo` is part of the React Hooks API and is often used to optimize expensive operations or computations that don't need to run every time a component renders.

## Syntax

```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeFunction(), [dependencies]);
```

- **computeFunction**: A function that performs the computation and returns a value.
- **dependencies**: An array of values that the memoized computation depends on. If these values don't change between renders, the previously memoized value is returned.

## When to Use `useMemo`

- **Expensive Calculations**: If a component performs a costly calculation and its result doesn't need to change unless specific inputs change, wrap it in `useMemo`.
- **Avoiding Unnecessary Re-Renders**: Use it to prevent re-rendering derived data unnecessarily.
- **Improving Performance**: When the computation impacts the rendering speed, `useMemo` can help improve the performance by memoizing results.

## Example Usage

### Without `useMemo`

```javascript
function ExpensiveComponent({ numbers }) {
  const expensiveCalculation = () => {
    console.log('Performing expensive calculation...');
    return numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
  };

  const result = expensiveCalculation();

  return <div>Result: {result}</div>;
}
```

In this example, the expensive calculation will run on every render, even if `numbers` hasn't changed.

### With `useMemo`

```javascript
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent({ numbers }) {
  const memoizedResult = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Performing expensive calculation...');
    return numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
  }, [numbers]);

  return <div>Result: {memoizedResult}</div>;
}
```

Here, the expensive calculation will only run when the `numbers` array changes, improving performance.

## Important Notes

1. **Avoid Premature Optimization**: Use `useMemo` only when you notice performance issues, as overusing it can make the code more complex without significant benefits.
2. **Shallow Comparison**: React compares dependencies using shallow comparison. If a dependency is an object or array, ensure it doesn't change unnecessarily between renders.
3. **Not for Side Effects**: `useMemo` should not be used for functions that produce side effects. Use `useEffect` for side effects instead.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Memoizing Too Much**: Over-memoizing may result in memory overhead without noticeable performance gains.
- **Incorrect Dependencies**: Ensure the dependencies array includes all values used in the memoized function to prevent bugs.

By effectively using `useMemo`, you can enhance the performance of your React application, particularly for components with heavy computation or frequent re-renders.

# Understanding Why `console.log('Calculate done!')` Executes in `cubeNum`

In the provided code, the `console.log('Calculate done!')` inside the `cubeNum` function is executed whenever the function `cubeNum` is called. Let's break down why and how often this happens:

## Code Analysis

### `cubeNum(number)` is called during rendering:

```javascript
const result = cubeNum(number);
```

Here, `cubeNum` is invoked directly during the rendering phase of the component. This means every time the component re-renders (due to state updates, props changes, etc.), the `cubeNum` function will run, and the `console.log('Calculate done!')` will execute.

### What causes re-renders in this component?

1. When the `number` state is updated via the input field (`steNumber`), it triggers a re-render.
2. When the `counter` state is updated via the `Counter++` button (`steCounter`), it also triggers a re-render.

### Why does `cubeNum` run on every re-render?

Since `cubeNum` is invoked directly in the render logic (`const result = cubeNum(number)`), it gets called every time the component re-renders, regardless of whether `number` has changed or not. This is because React will re-execute the entire component function during each render, and the function call is not memoized.

## Observed Behavior

- Changing the `number` input or clicking the `Counter++` button will both cause the component to re-render.
- As a result, the `cubeNum` function runs on every render, logging `Calculate done!` to the console each time.

## How to Optimize

If you only want to recalculate the cube of `number` when `number` changes, you can use `useMemo` to memoize the result:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [number, steNumber] = useState(0);
  const [counter, steCounter] = useState(0);

  function cubeNum(num) {
    console.log('Calculate done!');
    return Math.pow(num, 3);
  }

  const result = useMemo(() => cubeNum(number), [number]);

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="number"
        value={number}
        onChange={(e) => steNumber(Number(e.target.value))}
      />
      <h1>Cube of the number: {result}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => steCounter(counter + 1)}>Counter++</button>
      <h1>Counter: {counter}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Why Use `useMemo`?

- The computation inside `cubeNum` will now only execute when the `number` changes.
- Clicking the `Counter++` button will no longer cause `cubeNum` to run, avoiding unnecessary computations and logs.

### Explanation of Changes

- `useMemo(() => cubeNum(number), [number])`: Memoizes the result of `cubeNum(number)` and only recomputes it if `number` changes.
- This ensures the `console.log('Calculate done!')` is only printed when the input value changes, not on every re-render.

# UseCallback Hook

## UseCallback is a react hooks that lets you cache a function definiation between re-renders.

## it means, when we use the useCallback hook, it doesn't create multiple instance of same function when re-render happens.

## instead of creating new instance of the function, it provides the cached function on re-render of the component.

# Understanding the `useCallback` Hook

The `useCallback` hook in React is used to memoize functions. It ensures that the same instance of a function is returned unless its dependencies change. This can be particularly useful for optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-creation of functions during re-renders.

## Why Use `useCallback`?

1. **Prevent Unnecessary Function Re-Creation**:
   - In React, functions are recreated on every render. Passing these functions as props can trigger unnecessary re-renders of child components.
   - `useCallback` ensures the function is only recreated when its dependencies change.

2. **Optimize Performance with Memoized Components**:
   - When used with `React.memo`, `useCallback` prevents child components from re-rendering unnecessarily if the function props haven't changed.

## Syntax

```javascript
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  // Your logic here
}, [dependencies]);
```

- **`dependencies`**: An array of values that the callback depends on. The function is only re-created if one of these values changes.

## Example Without `useCallback`

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <ChildComponent onIncrement={increment} />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent({ onIncrement }) {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered');
  return <button onClick={onIncrement}>Increment</button>;
}

export default App;
```

### Problem
In this example, the `increment` function is recreated every time `App` re-renders. This causes `ChildComponent` to re-render unnecessarily, even if its props haven't changed.

## Optimized Example Using `useCallback`

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  }, []); // No dependencies, so the function is only created once.

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <ChildComponent onIncrement={increment} />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent({ onIncrement }) {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered');
  return <button onClick={onIncrement}>Increment</button>;
}

export default App;
```

### Benefits
- The `increment` function is now memoized and won't be recreated unless its dependencies change.
- `ChildComponent` will not re-render unnecessarily because the reference to `onIncrement` remains the same between renders.

## Common Use Cases

1. **Passing Callbacks to Child Components**:
   - Prevents re-renders of child components by ensuring the function reference is stable.

2. **Event Handlers**:
   - Use `useCallback` for memoizing event handlers in performance-critical applications.

3. **Dependencies in `useEffect`**:
   - Helps avoid unnecessary re-runs of effects by ensuring the function reference doesn't change unnecessarily.

## When Not to Use `useCallback`

- If the function is inexpensive to recreate or isn't passed as a prop, `useCallback` might add unnecessary complexity.
- Avoid overusing `useCallback` as it can make the code harder to read without significant performance benefits.

## Summary

The `useCallback` hook is a powerful tool for optimizing React applications by memoizing functions. It helps prevent unnecessary renders and ensures efficient use of resources. However, it should be used judiciously to balance performance and code simplicity.

- **`dependencies`**: An array of values that the callback depends on. The function is only re-created if one of these values changes.

## Example with Inline Comments

Below is an example component with inline comments explaining different aspects of `useCallback`.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const UseCallbackComp = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    // Without useCallback:
    // The function `newFn` would be recreated in memory every time the component re-renders.
    // This can lead to performance issues if passed to child components.
    // const newFn = () => { };

    // With an empty dependency array []:
    // The function `newFn` is only created once when the component is first rendered.
    // No new instance is created on subsequent renders unless the component unmounts and remounts.
    // const newFn = useCallback(() => { }, []);

    // With [count] as a dependency:
    // The function `newFn` will be recreated whenever `count` changes.
    // This ensures the function always has the latest value of `count` in its scope.
    const newFn = useCallback((count) => {
        console.log(`New function called with count: ${count}`);
    }, [count]);

    return (
        <>
            <div>
                {/* Passing the memoized function to the Header component */}
                <Header newFn={newFn} />
                
                <h1>{count}</h1>
                
                {/* Button to increment count and trigger re-render */}
                <button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Click Here</button>
            </div>
        </>
    );
};

export default UseCallbackComp;

// A simple Header component that accepts the memoized function as a prop.
const Header = ({ newFn }) => {
    console.log('Header component rendered');
    return <button onClick={() => newFn(42)}>Call Memoized Function</button>;
};
```

## Explanation of Comments

1. **Why Use `useCallback`**:
   - Without `useCallback`, `newFn` is recreated every time `UseCallbackComp` re-renders, even if `newFn`'s logic remains the same.
   - With `useCallback`, `newFn` is memoized, reducing unnecessary memory allocation and preventing child components (like `Header`) from re-rendering unless needed.

2. **Empty Dependency Array `[]`**:
   - When `useCallback` is used with an empty dependency array, the function is created only once and is not updated during re-renders.

3. **Dependency Array `[count]`**:
   - Adding `count` to the dependency array ensures `newFn` gets updated whenever `count` changes.
   - This is useful for cases where `newFn` relies on the latest value of `count`.

4. **Header Component**:
   - The `Header` component receives the memoized function `newFn` as a prop.
   - Since `newFn` is memoized, `Header` will not unnecessarily re-render unless `newFn` is updated.

## Benefits of This Implementation

- **Performance Optimization**: Avoids unnecessary re-renders of child components like `Header`.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Prevents the recreation of functions on each render.
- **Code Clarity**: Clearly defines when a function should update based on dependencies.

## Summary

The `useCallback` hook is a powerful tool for optimizing React applications. It is particularly useful when functions are passed as props to child components or used as dependencies in `useEffect`. However, it should be used judiciously, as overusing it can add unnecessary complexity without significant performance benefits.


# Understanding `useContext` Hook in React

React's `useContext` hook provides a way to manage and access context in functional components. Context allows you to share data (like themes, authentication status, or user preferences) between components without having to pass props down manually at every level of the component tree.

## How `useContext` Works
The `useContext` hook lets you consume a React context directly in a functional component. It simplifies accessing the context value without needing a `Consumer` component.

### Syntax
```javascript
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

Here:
- `MyContext` is the context object created using `React.createContext()`.
- `value` is the context value accessible within the component.

### Key Points
1. `useContext` must be used within a context provider.
2. When the provider’s value changes, all components using the context will re-render with the new value.

---

## Step-by-Step Example

### Setting Up Context
Let's create a complex example with a **theme management system** where a `ThemeContext` is used to toggle between light and dark modes.

### 1. Create the Context
```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

// Create a ThemeContext
export const ThemeContext = createContext();

export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
    const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

    const toggleTheme = () => {
        setTheme((prevTheme) => (prevTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
    };

    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
            {children}
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
};
```

### 2. Wrap the App with the Provider
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { ThemeProvider } from './ThemeContext';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
    <ThemeProvider>
        <App />
    </ThemeProvider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### 3. Consume the Context in Components
```javascript
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { ThemeContext } from './ThemeContext';

const Header = () => {
    const { theme, toggleTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

    return (
        <header
            style={{
                backgroundColor: theme === 'light' ? '#fff' : '#333',
                color: theme === 'light' ? '#000' : '#fff',
                padding: '10px',
                textAlign: 'center',
            }}
        >
            <h1>{theme.toUpperCase()} MODE</h1>
            <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
                Toggle Theme
            </button>
        </header>
    );
};

export default Header;
```

### 4. Use the Component
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Header />
            <main>
                <p>Welcome to the themed application!</p>
            </main>
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
```

---

## Explaining the Example
1. **Context Creation:** The `ThemeContext` provides a `theme` value and a `toggleTheme` function to its consumers.
2. **Provider:** The `ThemeProvider` wraps the application and shares the context value.
3. **Consumer:** The `Header` component accesses the `theme` and `toggleTheme` using `useContext` to dynamically change styles and behavior.

---

## Advanced Usage
### Nested Contexts
In complex applications, you might need multiple contexts.

```javascript
const UserContext = createContext();
const ThemeContext = createContext();

const App = () => (
    <UserContext.Provider value={{ name: 'John Doe' }}>
        <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme: 'dark' }}>
            <Dashboard />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    </UserContext.Provider>
);

const Dashboard = () => {
    const user = useContext(UserContext);
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

    return (
        <div style={{ color: theme.theme === 'dark' ? '#fff' : '#000' }}>
            Welcome, {user.name}!
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Re-renders:** When a context value changes, all consuming components re-render. Minimize unnecessary re-renders by splitting contexts based on usage.
- **Memoization:** Use `React.memo` or `useMemo` to optimize components consuming context.

---

## Conclusion
The `useContext` hook is a powerful tool for state sharing in React. It simplifies code by eliminating the need for prop drilling. By combining `useContext` with other hooks like `useReducer` or `useMemo`, you can build scalable and efficient React applications.



# useReducer hook

## useReduser is similar to useState, but instead of providing state & setter function. it providers state and dispatch function

## The useReducer hook accepts two arguments
- Reducer function
- initial state and returns: Current state and dispatch method

## The redicer function specifies how the state gets updated.

# Understanding `useReducer` Hook in React

The `useReducer` hook in React is a powerful alternative to `useState` for managing complex state logic. It is particularly useful when the state depends on previous values or when there are multiple state transitions tied to various actions.

---

## How `useReducer` Works

The `useReducer` hook lets you manage state using a reducer function. A reducer function takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state.

### Syntax
```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```
- `reducer`: A function that specifies how the state should change based on an action.
- `initialState`: The initial value of the state.
- `state`: The current state value.
- `dispatch`: A function to send actions to the reducer.

---

## Anatomy of a Reducer Function
A reducer function is a pure function with the following structure:

```javascript
function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'ACTION_TYPE':
            return { ...state, updatedProperty: action.payload };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
```

### Key Points
- The `state` parameter represents the current state.
- The `action` parameter contains a `type` and optionally a `payload` for additional data.
- The function must return a new state object.

---

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's create a **complex counter application** that supports multiple actions like incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the count, along with toggling a theme.

### 1. Setting Up the Reducer
```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = {
    count: 0,
    theme: 'light',
};

function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
            return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'DECREMENT':
            return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
        case 'RESET':
            return { ...state, count: 0 };
        case 'TOGGLE_THEME':
            return {
                ...state,
                theme: state.theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light',
            };
        default:
            throw new Error(`Unknown action type: ${action.type}`);
    }
}
```

### 2. Using the Reducer in a Component
```javascript
const CounterApp = () => {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

    return (
        <div
            style={{
                backgroundColor: state.theme === 'light' ? '#fff' : '#333',
                color: state.theme === 'light' ? '#000' : '#fff',
                padding: '20px',
                textAlign: 'center',
            }}
        >
            <h1>Count: {state.count}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>+</button>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>-</button>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'RESET' })}>Reset</button>
            <br /><br />
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'TOGGLE_THEME' })}>
                Toggle Theme
            </button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default CounterApp;
```

---

## Explaining the Example
1. **Reducer:** Manages both the count and theme state. Each action specifies how the state should update.
2. **Dispatching Actions:** The `dispatch` function is called with an action object to trigger state transitions.
3. **UI Updates:** The state values (`count` and `theme`) dynamically update the UI.

---

## Advanced Example: Managing Form State

`useReducer` can also be used to manage complex form states.

### Reducer for Form
```javascript
const formInitialState = {
    username: '',
    email: '',
    password: '',
};

function formReducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'UPDATE_FIELD':
            return { ...state, [action.field]: action.value };
        case 'RESET_FORM':
            return formInitialState;
        default:
            throw new Error(`Unknown action type: ${action.type}`);
    }
}
```

### Form Component
```javascript
const FormApp = () => {
    const [formState, dispatch] = useReducer(formReducer, formInitialState);

    const handleChange = (e) => {
        dispatch({
            type: 'UPDATE_FIELD',
            field: e.target.name,
            value: e.target.value,
        });
    };

    const handleReset = () => {
        dispatch({ type: 'RESET_FORM' });
    };

    return (
        <form>
            <label>
                Username:
                <input
                    name="username"
                    value={formState.username}
                    onChange={handleChange}
                />
            </label>
            <br />
            <label>
                Email:
                <input
                    name="email"
                    value={formState.email}
                    onChange={handleChange}
                />
            </label>
            <br />
            <label>
                Password:
                <input
                    name="password"
                    type="password"
                    value={formState.password}
                    onChange={handleChange}
                />
            </label>
            <br />
            <button type="button" onClick={handleReset}>
                Reset
            </button>
        </form>
    );
};

export default FormApp;
```

---

## When to Use `useReducer`
- When the state logic is complex and involves multiple sub-values.
- When the next state depends on the previous state.
- When managing state objects with many related actions.

---

## Conclusion
The `useReducer` hook provides a clean and scalable way to manage state in React applications. By separating state management into a reducer, you achieve better organization and maintainability, especially in applications with complex state logic.

# useLayoutEffect

## useLayoutEffect work similarly to useEffect, but it is called before the user interface gets mounted.

# Understanding `useLayoutEffect` Hook in React

The `useLayoutEffect` hook in React is a powerful tool for performing side effects that need to be completed before the browser paints the screen. It is similar to `useEffect`, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations and before the browser updates the screen. This makes it ideal for tasks like measuring DOM elements or synchronizing layouts.

---

## How `useLayoutEffect` Works

### Syntax
```javascript
useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // Side effect logic
    return () => {
        // Cleanup logic
    };
}, [dependencies]);
```
- **Callback:** The effect function to run synchronously.
- **Dependencies:** An array of variables that the effect depends on. The effect runs only when one of these variables changes.

### Key Differences Between `useLayoutEffect` and `useEffect`
1. **Execution Timing:**
   - `useLayoutEffect` runs after DOM mutations but before the browser repaints.
   - `useEffect` runs after the browser repaints.
2. **Use Case:**
   - `useLayoutEffect` is suited for DOM measurements or layout adjustments.
   - `useEffect` is preferred for non-blocking operations like fetching data.

---

## Step-by-Step Example

Let’s create a **tooltip component** that dynamically positions itself based on the size and position of a target element.

### 1. Tooltip Component
```javascript
import React, { useState, useRef, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';

const Tooltip = ({ targetRef, text }) => {
    const [position, setPosition] = useState({ top: 0, left: 0 });
    const tooltipRef = useRef(null);

    useLayoutEffect(() => {
        if (targetRef.current && tooltipRef.current) {
            const targetRect = targetRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
            const tooltipRect = tooltipRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();

            const top = targetRect.bottom + window.scrollY;
            const left = targetRect.left + targetRect.width / 2 - tooltipRect.width / 2;

            setPosition({ top, left });
        }
    }, [targetRef]);

    return (
        <div
            ref={tooltipRef}
            style={{
                position: 'absolute',
                top: `${position.top}px`,
                left: `${position.left}px`,
                backgroundColor: 'black',
                color: 'white',
                padding: '5px',
                borderRadius: '3px',
            }}
        >
            {text}
        </div>
    );
};

export default Tooltip;
```

### 2. Integrating the Tooltip
```javascript
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import Tooltip from './Tooltip';

const App = () => {
    const buttonRef = useRef(null);
    const [showTooltip, setShowTooltip] = useState(false);

    return (
        <div style={{ padding: '50px', position: 'relative' }}>
            <button
                ref={buttonRef}
                onMouseEnter={() => setShowTooltip(true)}
                onMouseLeave={() => setShowTooltip(false)}
                style={{ padding: '10px 20px' }}
            >
                Hover Me
            </button>
            {showTooltip && <Tooltip targetRef={buttonRef} text="This is a tooltip!" />}
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
```

---

## Explaining the Example
1. **useRef:** The `buttonRef` and `tooltipRef` are used to reference DOM elements.
2. **useLayoutEffect:** It ensures the tooltip’s position is calculated after the DOM has been updated but before the browser paints.
3. **Dynamic Positioning:** The tooltip’s position is updated using the `getBoundingClientRect()` method of the target element.

---

## Advanced Use Case: Synchronizing Animations

### Example: Animating a Box
```javascript
import React, { useState, useRef, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';

const AnimatedBox = () => {
    const [isAnimating, setIsAnimating] = useState(false);
    const boxRef = useRef(null);

## When to Use `useLayoutEffect`
- **Measuring DOM Elements:** Use it to calculate dimensions or positions before the browser repaints.
- **Synchronizing Layouts:** Adjust layouts immediately after DOM updates.
- **Animations:** Ensure CSS changes or animations are applied before the browser paints.

---

## Performance Considerations
1. **Blocking:** Since `useLayoutEffect` blocks the browser's painting process, overuse can lead to performance bottlenecks.
2. **Fallback to `useEffect`:** Use `useEffect` whenever synchronous execution is unnecessary.

---

## Conclusion
The `useLayoutEffect` hook is essential for scenarios where the layout needs to be adjusted synchronously after DOM updates but before the screen is rendered. While powerful, it should be used sparingly and only when `useEffect` is insufficient.
